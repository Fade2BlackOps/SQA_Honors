This is great so far! Yes, please add an order items table, I totally forgot about that. And yes, please simulate login and check out behavior in Java code. I want users to be able to select if they are logging in as an author, customer, or publisher. Each should sign in with an email address and password, which should query the table for logins that match the email address and password provided; if the combination is in the table the user can log in.
