# Bookstore Dev Log

## TO-DO:

### Implementation Tasks

- [x] Create and define classes
- [x] Create automated unit tests
- [ ] Debug unit tests
  - Running each unit individually seems to be working, but together breaks everything :/
- [ ] Build MySQL database
- [ ] Write main menu and usage loop

## Directory Details:

- `main/` → Holds the core application logic.
- `models/` → Contains business objects like `Book`, `Customer`, etc.
- `payments/` → Manages payment methods (Cash, Card, etc.).
- `shipping/` → Handles different shipping options.
- `utils/` → Helper functions (e.g., user input handling).
- `tests/` → Contains unit tests to ensure system reliability.
